<h3 class="sub-head">•	Bachelor of Technology (Btech):</h3>
<br>
<P>A Bachelor of Technology (BTech) degree program typically provides students with a strong foundation in technical skills and knowledge related to engineering, technology, or a specific technical field. Some common areas of study in a BTech program include computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and information technology.</P>
<br><br>
<h3 class="sub-head">•	Bachelor of Engineering(BE):</h3><br><br>
<h3 class="sub-head">Automobile Engineering</h3><br>

<P>Automobile engineering is a branch study of engineering[citation needed] which teaches manufacturing, designing, mechanical mechanisms as well as operations of automobiles. It is an introduction[citation needed] to vehicle engineering which deals with motorcycles, cars, buses, trucks, etc. It includes branch study of mechanical, electronic, software and safety elements.</P>
<br><br>
<h3 class="sub-head">Aerospace Engineering</h3><br>

<P>Aerospace engineering is the primary field of engineering concerned with the design, development, testing, and production of aircraft, spacecraft, and related systems and equipment. The field has traditionally focused on problems related to atmospheric and space flight, with two major and overlapping branches: aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering.

    Aeronautical Engineering focuses on the theory, technology, and practice of flight within the earth’s atmosphere.
    
    Astronautical Engineering focuses on the science and technology of spacecraft and launch vehicles.</P>
    <br><br>
<h3 class="sub-head">Nuclear Engineering</h3><br>
<P>Nuclear engineering is based on fundamental principles of physics and mathematics that describe nuclear interactions and the transport of neutrons and gamma rays. These phenomena in turn are dependent on heat transfer, fluid flow, chemical reactions, and behaviour of materials when subjected to radiation. Nuclear engineering is therefore inherently a multifaceted discipline, relying on several branches of physics, and, like the aerospace industry, it relies to a large extent on modeling and simulation for the design and analysis of complex systems that are too large and expensive to be tested.</P><br><br>
<h3 class="sub-head">Electrical and Electronics</h3><br>
<P>In engineering practice, the distinction between electrical engineering and electronics is usually based on the comparative strength of the electric currents used. In this sense, electrical engineering is the branch dealing with “heavy current”—that is, electric light and power systems and apparatuses—whereas electronics engineering deals with such “light current” applications as telephone and radio communication, computers, radar, and automatic control systems.</P><br><br>
<h3 class="sub-head">Mechanical Engineering</h3><br>
<P>
    Mechanical engineers design, build and develop mechanical and thermal sensing devices, such as engines, tools and machines. Mechanical engineering is one of the broadest engineering fields, according to BLS, and they can be found working on a vast range of products, from electric generators to batteries to refrigeration systems. 
    
    Mechanical engineers analyze projects to determine how a mechanical device can be used and then design and test machines to help the project. They can also investigate equipment that has failed to determine how part of the mechanics needs to be repaired, according to BLS.
    
    Similar occupations include materials engineer, petroleum engineer and mechanical engineering technician, according to BLS.</P> 
    <br><br>
<h3 class="sub-head">Civil Engineering</h3><br>
<P>Civil engineers solve infrastructure problems. The projects they design, build and maintain span a wide range in both the public and private sectors, including bridges, roads, tunnels, dams and water and sewer systems, according to BLS. 

    Infrastructure such as the Brooklyn Bridge, the Erie Canal and the Thames Tunnel in London were all made possible because of the work of civil engineers. Those are just three on a list of dozens of civil engineering landmarks listed by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).</P>
    <br><br>
<h3 class="sub-head">Software Engineering</h3>
<P>Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.</P>
<br>
<h3 class="sub-head">Marine Engineering</h3><br>
<p>Marine Engineering is the engineering of boats, ships, marine vessels or structures and oceanographic engineering. Marine Engineering draws on various engineering sciences for the operation and maintenance of marine vessels.

Industrial engineers may use knowledge of Maths, Physics but also Social Sciences to analyse, design, predict and evaluate the results and roadblocks of processes and devices. </p>
<br><br>
<h3 class="sub-head">Chemical Engineering</h3>
<br>
<p>Chemical engineers are in great demand because of the large number of industries that depend on the synthesis and processing of chemicals and materials. In addition to traditional careers in the chemical, energy, and oil industries, chemical engineers enjoy increasing opportunities in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, electronic device fabrication, and environmental engineering. The unique training of the chemical engineer becomes essential in these areas when processes involve the chemical or physical transformation of matter.</p> <br><br>
